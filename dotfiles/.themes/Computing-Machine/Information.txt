Computing Machine version 17.11 (Apr. 16, 2020) by Jamie Michelle ( https://github.com/Jamie-Michelle , https://www.opendesktop.org/u/jamiemichelle/ ). Released under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.

This Unix-like desktop-environment theme is entitled Computing Machine. It is for GTK+ 2/GNOME 2 applications; GTK+ 3/GNOME 3 applications; Qt 4/KDE 4 applications; and Qt 5/KDE 5 applications via the Qt5 Configuration Tool ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/qt5ct/ ). This theme was developed on the XFCE desktop environment.

The './gtk-2.0/gtkrc' file is a modification of the 'gtk-engines-2.20.2/themes/Redmond/gtk-2.0/gtkrc' file from https://download.gnome.org/sources/gtk-engines/2.20/gtk-engines-2.20.2.tar.bz2 (688171 bytes, MD5: 5deb287bc6075dc21812130604c7dc4f).

The './gtk-3.0/gtk.css' and './gtk-3.0/settings.ini' files are modified from files of Reactionary Creatures version of Aug. 23, 2018 ( https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1255961/ ; ReactionaryGTKCreatures.tar.gz , 32669 bytes, MD5: 76dc59f2a7d36ceb5f26f15cf0bbe53e) by phob1an ( https://www.opendesktop.org/u/phob1an/ , https://github.com/phobi4n ).

The files in the './xfwm4/' directory are modified from the 'xfwm4-themes-4.10.0/themes/default-4.8/' directory from https://archive.xfce.org/src/art/xfwm4-themes/4.10/xfwm4-themes-4.10.0.tar.bz2 (621206 bytes, MD5: eaa58362053a3549c8be0b32efd3c54f). See said archive for the SVG files from which the herein-included PNG files are derived.

The './xfce-notify-4.0/gtk.css' file is a modification of the 'xfce4-notifyd-0.4.4/themes/gtk-3.20/ZOMG-PONIES!/gtk.css' file from https://archive.xfce.org/src/apps/xfce4-notifyd/0.4/xfce4-notifyd-0.4.4.tar.bz2 (536304 bytes, MD5: 9614d4f7c0790e8ab24e55896a44a8ac).

####################

If this theme is located system-wide at '/usr/share/themes/Computing-Machine/' instead of user-specific at '~/.themes/Computing-Machine/', make sure that all the files of this theme have the correct permissions, which can be done with the following command:

$ cd /usr/share/themes/Computing-Machine/ && find . -type f | xargs sudo chmod 644

####################

To enable the GTK+ 2 portion of the theme for a specific user, include the below in the '~/.gtkrc-2.0' file (using your preferred icon set and system font; and excluding the doubled quotation marks [""] used to indicate a block quotation):

""
# ~/.gtkrc-2.0
#
# Configurations for GTK+ 2 programs.

# Make sure the following file has the file-permission of 644 (-rw-r--r--)
include "/usr/share/themes/Computing-Machine/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"
gtk-icon-theme-name="Faenza"
gtk-font-name="Cantarell 10"

""

Also put the following line in the '~/.profile' file:

""
export GTK2_RC_FILES="$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0"

""

####################

Set the 'qt5ct' program (by Ilya Kotov, https://sourceforge.net/projects/qt5ct/ ) on Appearance > Style: gtk2.

Putting

""
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct

""

in the '/etc/environment' file fixed a problem concerning Firefox not opening the KDE Dolphin file-manager with icons or the right theme, after logging out and back into the window manager.

A recommended icon set to use with the Qt 5/KDE 5 portion of this theme is Oxygen. When installed on one's system, the icon set can be selected via the 'qt5ct' program's Icon Theme tab.

Also ensure that the following two lines are in the '~/.profile' file:

""
export GTK2_RC_FILES="$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0"
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct

""

In order for 'qt5ct' to work with GTK+ 2 styles, it requires the 'qtstyleplugins' software (from https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtstyleplugins , https://github.com/qt/qtstyleplugins ). On Arch Linux-based distributions, said software is the package named 'qt5-styleplugins'; on Debian-based systems, it is the package named 'qt5-style-plugins'.

Besides the 'qtstyleplugins' software for making GTK+ 2 styles work with Qt 5 applications, one can also use the program 'qt5gtk2' by Ilya Kotov ( https://bitbucket.org/trialuser02/qt5gtk2/ ). In which case, set the 'qt5ct' application on Appearance > Style: qt5gtk2.

Alternatively, the 'qt5ct' program does not have to be used, as one can use the following environment variable instead in the '/etc/environment' and '~/.profile' files when 'qtstyleplugins' is installed. However, one then loses the ability to select icon sets and fonts specifically for the Qt 5 applications, which will instead use whatever is set for the GTK+ 2 portion of the theme.

Line for the '/etc/environment' file when not using the 'qt5ct' program:

""
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2

""

Lines for the '~/.profile' file when not using the 'qt5ct' program:

""
export GTK2_RC_FILES="$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0"
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2

""

If one is instead using the 'qt5gtk2' software, then the above 'QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=' lines would contain 'qt5gtk2' in place of 'gtk2'.

As an aside which might be of help in some instances, note also the following nonexhaustive examples of Qt 5 application switches and environment variables, which can be used in various combinations:

$ dolphin --platformtheme gtk2

$ dolphin --style motif

$ QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2 dolphin

$ QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=cde dolphin

$ QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=windows QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=windows dolphin

Additionally, contained in the included './Extras/' directory is the 'Computing-Machine.conf' file, which can be placed in either the '/usr/share/qt5ct/colors/' directory or the '~/.config/qt5ct/colors/' directory so that the 'qt5ct' program can use the Computing Machine color-palette with different interface styles (selectable under Appearance > Palette > Custom [checked] > Color scheme: Computing-Machine). In order to have dialogue button-layouts match the GTK sequence when using different interface styles with the 'qt5ct' program, set it via Interface > Dialog buttons layout: GNOME, rather than via Appearance > Standard dialogs: GTK2, which instead is best left on Default.

####################

In order to adjust the theme settings for Qt 4/KDE 4 applications, see the below program. Also see the settings files '/etc/xdg/Trolltech.conf' and/or '~/.config/Trolltech.conf'.

$ qtconfig-qt4

####################

In order for the GTK+ 2 portion of this theme to work across different window managers and desktop environments, put the following in the '/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc' file (using your preferred icon set and system font):

""
gtk-theme-name="Computing-Machine"
gtk-icon-theme-name="Faenza"
gtk-font-name="Cantarell 10"

""

In order for the GTK+ 3 portion of this theme to work across different window managers and desktop environments, put the following in the '/etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini' file (using your preferred icon set and system font):

""
[Settings]
gtk-theme-name=Computing-Machine
gtk-icon-theme-name=Faenza
gtk-font-name=Cantarell 10

""

Note that if the foregoing system-wide settings are instated then one does not have to instate user-specific setting in the '~/.gtkrc-2.0' and '~/.profile' files (indeed, one can do away with the '~/.gtkrc-2.0' file entirely). However, one of the above-detailed environment variables in the '/etc/environment' file should still be used.

####################

On the XFCE desktop environment, the Computing Machine theme can be selected via the Appearance program ('xfce4-appearance-settings').

On the XFCE desktop environment, the window-manager portion of the Computing Machine theme ('./xfwm4/') can be selected via the Window Manager program ('xfwm4-settings').

On the XFCE desktop environment, the notifier portion of the Computing Machine theme ('./xfce-notify-4.0/') can be selected via the Notifications program ('xfce4-notifyd-config').

The Computing Machine theme can be selected as the theme of the LightDM GTK+ Greeter ('lightdm-gtk-greeter', https://launchpad.net/lightdm-gtk-greeter ) via the Settings Editor for LightDM GTK+ Greeter ('lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings' or 'lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings-pkexec', https://launchpad.net/lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings ) when the Computing Machine theme is installed system-wide at '/usr/share/themes/Computing-Machine/'. Alternatively, one does not have to use said Settings Editor, as the theme of the LightDM GTK+ Greeter can be set by directly editing its '/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf' file.

####################

The Computing Machine theme presently doesn't work well with LibreOffice ( https://www.libreoffice.org ). To activate a theme that does work well with LibreOffice, put the following line in the '~/.profile' file (for user-specific activation):

""
export SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN=gen

""

Or put the following line in the '/etc/environment' file (for system-wide activation):

""
SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN=gen

""

Then upon logging out and back into one's window manager, the generic X Window System (X11) theme for LibreOffice should be active. To select a LibreOffice theme color that matches well with Computing Machine, from LibreOffice's menu select Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Personalization > [check] Preinstalled Theme > Gray.

(The foregoing information was tested with LibreOffice 6.2.8.)
